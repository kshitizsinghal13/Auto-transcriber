 The Pencils Tale  Once upon a time, an old pencil maker took his newest pencil aside just before he was about to pack him into a box.  Imagine the little fellow as a person. He recalled a few things about the pencil.  There are five things you need to know he said to his pencil.  Before I send you out into the world, always remember these five things never forget them.  And you will become the best pencil you can be.  The first thing is to remember that you will be able to do many great things,  but only if you put yourself in someone else's hands.  From time to time, you will experience a painful sharpening,  but remember that this will make you a better pencil.  Also, keep in mind that you will be able to correct any mistakes you might make along the way.  And the most important part of you is what's on the inside.  And remember this as well, upon every surface that you are used, you must leave your mark,  no matter what else happens, you must continue to write.  It seemed the pencil listened to him,  and promised he would remember these five things,  so that he could live his life with heart and purpose.  You see in life, in your life, put yourself in someone else's hand,  and brace challenges for growth, learn from mistakes,  value inequalities, and leave a positive mark on the world.  And you too, can become the best pencil there is.  This was the pencil's tale, and this is their to-do motivation.  Thank you so much for watching, and stay blessed.
